      <p>A world where hunters, humans who possess magical abilities, must battle deadly monsters to protect the human race from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability to level up in strength, possibly beyond any known limits. Follow Jinwoo's journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.</p>
      <p>Sung Jinwoo is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, he got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter and the new Shadow Monarch.</p>

      <p>Jinwoo is a muscular and handsome young man with gray eyes, sharp facial features, and neat black hair. When using his powers or agitated, his eyes glow bright purple. He is also almost always seen wearing dark colors, particularly black.</p>
      <p>Jinwoo is a confident individual with a strong sense of family and a thirst for strength. As a result, he is very close to his sister, mother, and Jinho, and rarely wastes an opportunity to grow stronger.
It should also be noted that despite being the strongest hunter in the world, Jinwoo is not particularly arrogant and is both polite and easygoing in-person. He is also mostly indifferent to materialistic desires such as fame and fortune.</p>
